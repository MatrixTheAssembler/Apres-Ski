In this project the backward dynamic programming concept was used.

The exercise was to find the optimal strategy for a shop. It calculates the optimal action at every state at every time point.
Every state is a combination of the number of beverages (max 200) and the number of food (max 100). Every action is a combination of how much to buy from each. How much could be bought depends on the daytime (am or pm).
